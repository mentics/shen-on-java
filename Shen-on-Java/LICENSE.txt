However, if you take this code and create a competing commercial version (aka. a for-pay shen on java product based on this code), I will stand up, sit down, fidget, frown in your general direction, and contact you asking why you would do such a horrible thing--so please don't.
Use of any of this code in non-competing commercial situations are fine (subject to apache license mentioned above), especially if you send me a thank you email and hire my company (we provide support, development, etc. email info@mentics.com). 

The Java source and bytecode that is generated from compiling your Shen code is considered to be your code.
