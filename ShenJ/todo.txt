Fix handle-java-call to call parse java call

Optimization: Instead of ToEval stuff, use anon classloader

[do | Args] -> Args @p first evaled then second of last arg for expression


I think the error matching won't work when it supports class name from .../module/func

For partial application, don't create a new lambda, use the one that already exists that the function field is assigned to
so... shenj.root.Str.LAMBDA kind of thing or Primitives.str kind of thing

store original shen code and java code for each function in globalprops to allow access to them at runtime?


--------  Done  ----------------

fix str so it matches spec as clarified
